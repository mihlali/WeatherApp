WEATHER APP

## Where to start

- This App uses the https://openweathermap.org/current to get the current weather for the day and a forecast for the next few days
- This app is built using swiftUI and UIKit, swiftUI is used for the reusable views and then the main screen is built in UIkit
- this project will require the users location and it will ask the user for their location. it cannot work with out that permission
- the are no other libraries to run this app, you can just build and run it
